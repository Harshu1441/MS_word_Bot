[About]--
---------------------------------------------

The project MS word bot is to help people to adopt the excel software more easily as people don't like to spend time watching a video and reading the official guide with this bot they could just specify simple things like -
-help
-cmd screenshot
-about ribbon
-fuction command use = f1-f12
(these are actual terms that you could use to interact with the bot)
As the above information suggests how it could be used, the project is based on azure QnA service that helps you train a bot (special thanks to futurereadytalent to provide the student dev pack), It is a fully functional and conversational bot.
